Statistical Programming with Python
===================================

Functions + Conditionals


Plan for today
==============

Boolean expressions

Functions

Conditional execution

Functions
=========

Functions are sequences of instructions that we store to be executed
later

Calling functions
=================

The syntax for calling functions is the following:

    function_name(parameter1, parameter2)

Calling functions
=================

Declaring functions
===================

We can declare our own functions using the def keyword with the
following syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    #function body
```

Declaring functions
===================

When creating a function we need to indent the body.  Then we will need
to de-indent it to denote the end of the body

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    #function body
```

Creating functions
==================

Returning values from functions 
================================

Functions in Python can return values after doing all the operations
they perform.

Returning values from functions 
================================

Functions can have parameters
=============================

Parameters are values that are injected to the function body when we
call it

Functions can have parameters
=============================

Boolean operations
==================

We\'re going to learn two kinds of operators that operate on booleans 
Comparision and logical operators.

 

Boolean operations are useful for conditional execution.

[Comparision operators]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
================================================

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  name                                description\
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  x == y                              x is equal to y

  x != y                              x is not equal to y

  x \> y                              x is greater than y

  x \< y                              x is lesser than y

  x \>= y                             x is greater than or equal than y

  x \<= y                             x is lesser than or equal than y

  x is y                              x is the same as y

  x is not y                          x is not the same as y
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Comparision operators]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
================================================

[Logical operators]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
============================================

  name      description
  --------- ----------------------------------------
  x and y   returns True if x and y are true
  x or y    returns True if either x or y are true
  not x     negates x

[Logical operators]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
============================================

[Conditional execution]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
================================================

   Almost all useful programs need to be able to check conditions and
change its behaviour accordingly.  That\'s what conditional execution
provides.

 

[Conditional execution]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
================================================


If statement
============

the if statement is the tool we use for conditional execution in Python

``` {.stylus}
if <condition>:
    <body>
```

If statement
============

Else clause
===========

The else clause is executed when the condition is evaluated to false:

``` {.stylus}
if <condition>:
    <block>
else:
    <block>
```

Else clause
===========

Elif clause
===========

Elif clauses are used when there are more possibilities:

```python
if <condition>:
    <block>
elif <condition>:
    <block>
else:
    <block>
```

Elif clause
===========

Recap
=====

Create functions with def. Return to produce a value at the end

Combine comparision & logical operators to check the conditions you need

Use if, else, elif for conditional execution

Homework
========

``` {.stylus}
1. Create a function ~weekly_commute_time~ that asks the user their
   daily commute time and returns their weekly time spent commuting.

2. What do the following expressions return?
   1. ~True or 11 > 34~
   2. ~False and (1 == 1)~
   3. ~(77 // 11) > 6 and False~

3. Create a function ~area_triangle~ that takes the base and height of
   a triangle and returns its area

4. Create function ~area_triangle_rectangle~ that takes the base,
   height, and the kind of shape and calculates its area.  It should
   work for both triangles and rectangles.

5. Create a function ~im_in_love~ that takes a weekday number (from
   monday to friday), and returns how that weekday is (according to
   The Cure!):

   > I don't care if Monday's blue
   > Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
   > Thursday I don't care about you
   > It's Friday, I'm in love
```

Optional work
=============

``` {.stylus}
1. Create a function that solves quadratic equations.

2. Create a function to calculate the area of (regular) pentagons

3. Create a function to calculate the area of squares

4. Create a function that receives the side, and a polygon name
   (either pentagon or square), and calculates its area.
```
