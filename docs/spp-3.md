Statistical Programming in Python
=================================

Arithmetic + Variables


Plan for today
==============

-   Python basic datatypes

-   Variables

-   Operators

Datatypes
=========

Datatypes tell Python how we want to use the data.  There are several
primitive data types in Python such as bool, int, str, float.

Integers
========

Integers (or ints) represent whole numbers without decimal parts.  We
create them by using their numeric representation directly

Integers
========

Floating point numbers
======================

floats represent numbers that have a fractional part.  We use a dot to
separate the integer and fractional parts

```python
3.14
1.0
33.33
```

Floating point numbers
======================

Strings
=======

Strings are used for textual representation. They can be created using
either double or simple quotes.

```python
'this is a string'
"this is another string"
```

Strings
=======

Booleans
========

Booleans represent truthiness. There are only two values in for the bool
type in Python: True and False

```python
True
False
```

Booleans
========

Datatypes
=========

What datatype would you use for the following?

 

-   Storing the age of an user
-   Is the user underage?
-   A phone number
-   The contents of a book

Getting the type of a value
===========================

We can always ask ask a value for its type using the **type(value)**
function

```python
type("patata")
```

Getting the type of a value
===========================

Inside Spyder, check what\'s the type of the following expressions:

```python
"there is some text here"
1
True
44.4
'true'
'False'
2
'33.3'
```

Operators
=========

Operators are symbols in the language that perform different kinds of
computations on values

They\'re binary

Arithmetic Operators
====================

  symbol   meaning
  -------- ------------------
  \+       sum
  \-       substraction
  \*       multiplication
  /        division
  \*\*     exponentiation
  //       floored division
  \%       modulus

Arithmetic Operators
====================

In Spyder, do the following exercises:

 

-   Calculate the **area of a circle** of radius 2
-   Calculate the **volume of a sphere** of radius 2

Rules of precedence
===================

-   Parentheses
-   Exponentiation
-   Multiplication/Division
-   Sum/Substraction
-   when operators have the same precedence, evaluate left to right

Rules of precedence
===================

String operators
================

sum and multiplication operators work on strings too.  They\'re used to
concatenate and multiply strings, respectively

String operators
================

Show some examples of string concatenation & multiplication

Variables
=========

Variables are names that point to values in Python.

Variables
=========

Naming variables
================

It\'s important to be as descriptive as possible when naming variables

There are some naming rules we should obey

Naming variables
================

Naming rules
============

-   Variable names can\'t start with a number

-   Variable names can\'t contain special characters such as !, @, .

-   Can\'t be one of the reserved words  

Reserved words
==============

    and       del       from      None      True\
    as        elif      global    nonlocal  try\
    assert    else      if        not       while\
    break     except    import    or        with\
    class     False     in        pass      yield\
    continue  finally   is        raise\
    def       for       lambda    return

Mutability
==========

In Python variables are mutable. This means that we can change their
value at any time

```python
name = "Pepe"
print(name)

name = "Jose"
print(name)
```

Mutability
==========

Converting values
=================

There are some times when we need to convert a value from one type to
another.

 

We use the int(), bool(), str(), and float() functions for that

```python
int('23')

bool(1)

bool(0)

str(True)

float("3.2")
```

Converting values
=================

Printing output
===============

One can print output using the **print()** function

User input
==========

There is a handy function **input()** that allows us to capture input
from the user

```python
name = input("Tell me your name: ")

print("hello, " + name)
```

Practice
========

Create a program that asks the user for their age and returns the year
they were born

Recap
=====

-   Datatypes (int, float, bool, str)
-   Variables (naming, mutability)
-   Operators (arithmetic, precedence, string operators)
-   Converting values
-   User input

Exercises
=========

```python
1. Create a program that calculates the total number of seconds in an hour
2. How does the following expression evaluate?

   2 + (3 + 4) + (5 * 33 ** 34)

3. Create a program that asks the user for their age and their mother's 
   age and calculate the age difference

4. What are the results and result types of the following expressions?
   think it yourself, do not use the Python console for this

   3 * 5 * 2
   3 / 11
   3 // 11
   25 % 2

5. Make the following expressions work (use Python console for this one)
   3 + "3"
   'there are ' + 4 ' dogs barking'
```
